				<p>Hi everyone! I am a front-end developer and I've been part of the IT industy for about 2 years. 
					I decided to change careers inspired by the technological advances and the immense creativity and
					innovation that the IT industry has to offer. I am both a visual and a logical person, and I find these two sides fitting 
					perfectly into my current profession. I enjoy working on visually attractive web applications, 
					written in clean, functional and optimized code, using the latest technologies. At the moment I am mostly working with
					React and on the side I do UX/UI web design gigs. I am deatail-oriented, curious, 
					adaptable and dedicated, and I see myself working in a creative environment, in diverse and ambitious teams, 
					where I can grow as a developer and deliver excellent products. I am always open to learning new technologies, working on different 
					projects and expanding my skills and knowledge.

				<h3>Sourcico</h3>
				<h4>Web Developer</h4>
				<p>After finishing my web development studies, I started a 4-month internship in Sourcico, where from day one I had the chance to work with a highly
					productive team, working on a complex and sophisticated software in an international environment. I quickly gained a lot of practical skills that enabled
					me to grow from a web developer student to a web developer in a very short period of time. After my internship finished, I continued as 
					a full-time employee in the same company and the same team. <a href="www.perion.com">Perion</a>, the project that we are working on, 
					is a digital advertising ecosystem that consists of several applications and microservices. Working on such a challenging project offers me
					a constant opportunity for growth and advancement, and this is what I love the most about my current job. The stack that we are using is React/Node.js.

				<h3>SEAVUS Education And Development Center</h3>
				<h4>Web Development Academy Student</h4>
				<p>During my studies I immersed myself deep into web-development. From HTML, CSS and JS, to C#, MVC, ASP.NET, Databases, etc, I got
					a chance to explore the development process from the begining to the end. One of my most enjoyable projects was
					 the making of 'Makdental Web Page' where I worked in a team of 8 students.
					I was responsible for client communication and consultation, wireframing and full-design (clickable prototype)
					 based on client requirements, front-end implementation (partial), client presentations in stage 1 (design)
						and stage 2 (front-end)  and team management (basic scrum). This project enabled me to gain valuable real-life 
					experience in the insdustry. </p>
				<!-- <h3>M3DS Academy for 3D Printing and Game Design </h3>
				<h4>3D Design and Printing</h4>
				<p>3D Modeling is exciting and challenging and it gave me a completely new perspective on design. 
					Using Autodesk Maya and ZBrush, two very complex design tools, I learned how to create my own 3D designs or replicate 3D models using blueprints. 
					The design process in Maya has a more technical note, whereas in ZBrush it almost feels like sculpturing with clay. I also learned preparation of models for 3D print 
					and working with the Ender 3-V2 3D Printer.</p> -->

				<h3>University Ss.Cyril and Methodius</h3>
				<h4>Doctor of Dental Medicine</h4>
				<p>Studying dentistry taught me all about hard work, determination, time management and studying smart.
					During my 6-year studies I developed a habit of continuous dedication which was my key for success.
					I was awarded with a state scholarship for talented students in Medical Science Studies for each 
					academic year from 2013 to 2017. During my university years I also worked, volunteered and travelled.
					By the age of 24 I had a graduate degree and I visited 42 countries, mostly through participation in 
					international projects, conferences, camps, symposiums, training courses and exchanges. Those years have been
					truly formative and were a crucial part of my development as a person and as a professional.

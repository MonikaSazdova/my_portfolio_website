				<p>Hi everyone! I am a front-end developer and newby in the industry. 
					I decided to change careers inspired by the technological advances and the immense creativity, 
					innovation and opportunities that the IT industry has to offer. I am both a visual and a logical person, and I find these two sides fitting 
					perfectly into my current profession. I enjoy working on visually attractive web applications, 
					written in clean, functional and optimized code, using the latest technologies. Out of all the languages 
					I have had the chance to learn, I enjoy using JavaScript the most. At the moment I am exploring
					React and I spend some of my time learning more about web design, UX and UI. I am deatail-oriented, curious, 
					adaptable and dedicated, and I see myself working in a creative environment, in diverse and ambitious teams, 
					where I can grow as a developer and deliver excellent products.

				<h3>SEAVUS Education And Development Center</h3>
				<h4>Web Development Academy</h4>
				<p>During my studies I immersed myself deep into web-development. From HTML, CSS and JS, to C#, MVC, ASP.NET, Databases, etc, I got
					a chance to explore the development process from the begining to the end. One of my most enjoyable projects was
					 the making of 'Makdental Web Page' where I worked in a team of 8 students.
					I was responsible for client communication and consultation, wireframing and full-design (clickable prototype)
					 based on client requirements, front-end implementation (partial), client presentations in stage 1 (design)
						and stage 2 (front-end)  and team management (basic scrum). This project enabled me to gain valuable real-life 
					experience in the insdustry. </p>

				<h3>M3DS Academy for 3D Printing and Game Design </h3>
				<h4>3D Design and Printing</h4>
				<p>3D Modeling is exciting and challenging and it gave me a completely new perspective on design. 
					Using Autodesk Maya and ZBrush, two very complex design tools, I learned how to create my own 3D designs or replicate 3D models using blueprints. 
					The design process in Maya has a more technical note, whereas in ZBrush it almost feels like sculpturing with clay. I also learned preparation of models for 3D print 
					and working with the Ender 3-V2 3D Printer.</p>

				<h3>University Ss.Cyril and Methodius</h3>
				<h4>Doctor of Dental Medicine</h4>
				<p>Studying dentistry taught me all about hard work, determination, time management and studying smart.
					 During my 6-year studies I developed a habit of continuous dedication which was my key for success.
						I was awarded with a state scholarship for talented students in Medical Science Studies for each 
						academic year from 2013 to 2017. In my university years I also worked, volunteered and travelled.
						 By the age of 24 I had a graduate degree, and I visited 42 countries, mostly through participation in 
						 international projects, conferences, camps, symposiums, training courses and exchanges.
